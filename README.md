# Trellis User Interface

A web-based user interface for TrellisLDP servers.

**This project is experimental and not yet fully functional**

This code requires at least Trellis 0.7 in order to run.

The Trellis backend is assumed to be located at `http://localhost:8080/`, if that is different, set an
environment variable: `export REACT_APP_BASE_URL=http://trellis.example.com/`.

For downloading the dependencies, run once `npm install`

When building via `npm build` be sure to verify the `homepage` value in `package.json`.

To start the development server, run `npm start`
